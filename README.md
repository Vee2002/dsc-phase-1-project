# Phase 1 Project
## Business Problem
This project is analysing movie datasets to come up with solutions to help Microsoft create a movie studio and genres of movies they'll film in their movie stuido

### The Data
The data I used was the following :
 - Title of movies
 - Runtime of movies
 - Year of release
 - Genres of the moveis
 - Average rating of each movie
 - Number of votes of each movie
 - The domestic and foreign gross
 - And the studio that filmed each movie

## Recommendations to Microsoft from the Analysis.

 - To invest more in genres such as Sci-Fi, Drama, Action, Comedy, Adventure and Documentaries
 - And to partner or seek advise from studios such as IFC, Uni. and Fox Studios.
